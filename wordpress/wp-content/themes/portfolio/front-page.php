					<h1> Technologies that we use </h1>

					<img src="<?php echo get_option('home'); ?>/wp-content/themes/portfolio/img/tech.png" class="img-responsive img-tech" alt="Responsive image">

					<p> I use the likes of Bootstrap, jQuery, CSS 3 & HTML 5 to develop highly functionable websites. This ensures that your website not only works on a desktop but also works on mobile devices too. I use Adobe's Photoshop CS6 to design and create wireframes before I start developing your website. </p>
